- This repo requires the setup of two .env files locally in order to function.

- .env.development and .env.test files both have to be added to the main repo folder.

- They must contain the PGDATABASE= command set to the name of your local development and test databases, respectively. All necessary requires for these in the rest of the code have already been set up.
